COVID-19 Insights & Tracing Cases in India

📊 I've been hard at work creating a comprehensive and informative dashboard that visualizes COVID-19 Insights & Tracing Cases in India. This project aims to provide valuable insights into the trends and patterns of COVID-19 across different states in India.

🔍 Key Metrics:
•	Total Doses
•	Covaxin Distribution
•	Negative Cases
•	Positive Cases
•	Total Samples

🗺️ Tracing Cases: Diving deep into tracing COVID-19 cases reveals regional disparities and hotspot areas. Maharashtra emerges with the highest count of positive cases, shedding light on the areas most affected by the virus.

💉 Vaccination Efforts: The dashboard maps the distribution of vaccine doses across states, showcasing the government's initiatives to inoculate the population. It offers insights into the progress of vaccination campaigns and areas that may require further attention.

⏰ Temporal Trends: Analyzing temporal trends illustrates the increase in total doses administered throughout 2021. Through visual representations, audiences can observe the trajectory of vaccination campaigns and the evolution of response measures to the pandemic
